# Getting Started

2. Open up command prompt/terminal on your computer and download the VEXCode template via:

    cd Desktop

    git clone https://github.com/ConnorAtmos/WhoopLibVEXCode

    And now you are ready to configure and jump into the action with the most powerful SLAM solution in VEX!

3. Open the project in VSCode

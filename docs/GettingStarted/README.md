# Getting Started

1. Install VSCode

2. Open up command prompt/terminal on your computer and download the VEXCode template via:

    ```bash
    cd Desktop

    git clone https://github.com/ConnorAtmos/WhoopLibVEXCode
    ```
    And now you are ready to configure and jump into the action with the most powerful SLAM solution in VEX!

3. Open the project in VSCode

4. Install "VEX Robotics" Extension in VSCode

5. You should be prompted to install the C++ extension by Microsoft. This would be using Intellisense (clangd may not work with the VEXCode extension)

Now you are ready! Move on to [Configuring Odometry](ConfiguringOdometry/README.md)
